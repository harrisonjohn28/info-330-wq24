-- Q4: reflection on what you learned and challenges

-- The design and implementation of our SQL database began with an important
-- first step in understanding our business case problem; 911 dispatcher data
-- (public safety industry). The step was crucial in the formation of everything
-- that stemmed afterwards because we laid a foundation for who our typical users
-- would be; Community Members, Residents, Investors, Law Enforcement,
-- Researchers, Journalists/Media Outlets, and or City council/government
-- officials. As well as which representative questions (queries) we would want
-- our typical users to be able to answer. From this strong base we were able to
-- pivot into creating an initial entity relationship diagram (ERD) which is a
-- task that one can make as hard or as easy as one would like depending on the
-- kinds of questions we need or want to be answered from our database. The
-- database schema design was ultimately difficult for us because of the wide
-- freedom we had to work from, this forced us to think very carefully and be
-- meticulous on how we wanted to structure the ERD to answer the representative
-- questions we proposed earlier in the project process. 

-- This required us to make careful considerations of entities, attributes,
-- relationships, and constraints. Through this process, we gained a deeper
-- understanding of entity-relationship modeling, which facilitated the
-- translation of conceptual models into the physical database structures we
-- implemented once we started to actually write the SQL code. Once we revised
-- our ERD and began coding, we faced another unique challenge in that to work
-- collaboratively on our code base; particularly creating the physical tables in
-- pgAdmin we had to all meet in person and work from one groups members laptop
-- because we couldnâ€™t individually work on assignment parts necessary because of
-- the foreign key relationships among all of the tables so it was hard to
-- initially figure how we would exactly divide up the tasks without being
-- inefficient. Another potential difficulty we faced was SQL Query Optimization.
-- We spent most of our time just trying to finish and get our queries to work
-- rather than taking time to think at all about crafting efficient queries for
-- improving database performance. Learning about query optimization techniques
-- such as indexing, query rewriting, and analysis is assumed to be an
-- instrumental part in enhancing a database's responsiveness and scalability
-- especially in industry. We also had trouble with creating some of our demo
-- data to test if some of our queries actually work and potential edge cases.
-- The difficulty here came from interpreting and managing the complex
-- relationships between our entities and resolving inconsistencies in data
-- dependencies such as foreign keys between relations. The way we addressed
-- these challenges was by making sure to meet as a group in person to complete
-- nearly every project assignment, that way we resolved any confusion about our
-- data and were able to divide up our workload very effectively. We resolved
-- some data dependency problems by modifying some of our foreign key
-- relationships in order for some of our queries to be answered. In addition
-- to this we made use of SQL Documentation as we all had forgotten some of our
-- prior learned techniques. So we referred back to old powerpoint slides from
-- past lectures as well as reading SQL documentation online. Through this
-- reflective analysis, we have gained a deeper appreciation for the intricacies
-- involved in database management and the importance of adaptability,
-- collaboration, and continuous iterative improvement in overcoming expected
-- challenges.
